## Classes-Objects-javaScript

# Classes
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
Classes in JS are built on <b>prototypes</b> but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes

# Description
Defining classes
Classes are in fact <b>"special functions"</b>, and just as you can define <b>function expressions</b> and <b>function declarations</b>,<br> 
a class can be defined in two ways: a <b>class expression</b> or a <b>class declaration.</b>

# Objects
In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like arrays to the browser <b>APIs</b><br> built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to <br> encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages and act as handy<br> data containers. The object-based nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go<br> further with your knowledge of the language, therefore we've provided this module to help you.<br> Here we teach object theory and syntax in detail, then look at how to create your own objects.
