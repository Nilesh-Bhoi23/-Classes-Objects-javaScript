Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
Classes in JS are built on <b>prototypes</b> but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes

a class can be defined in two ways: a <b>class expression</b> or a <b>class declaration.</b>
